# Preface

This book is in a notes status, formed as a collection of lessons. The structure of the book and its content will change significantly through its development. It is published online in this state, in an effort to share continued development and progress. My hope that the information here in is useful in some capacity. A document of this scope is a significant undertaking and getting it right as Leptos and Rust evolve in context of my own knowledge will take time.

And so, pardon the multitude of typos, partial thoughts, potentially out of date bits of codeâ€”caveat emptor and enjoy.

Peace,
    John
