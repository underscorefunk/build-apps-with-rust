# Notice to Reader

Learning a framework that is still growing and changing is a difficult task. Creating helpful resources that keep up with the framework is a challenge upon that. Here are some resources to help you along your journey as we build out documentation.

>This book is still _very_ much a work in progress. It is online in the hope that it will help folk, even in its very incomplete and unedited state.

## Tips for learning Leptos

1) Join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/qdpf7msQ)
2) Subscribe to the [YouTube channel of Greg Johnston (gbj)](https://www.youtube.com/@gbjxc), the founding author of Leptos.
3) Listen to the [Rustacean Station Podcast episode](https://rustacean-station.org/episode/greg-johnston/) with Greg Johnston
4) Leptos is heavily inspired by the SolidJS framework. [Watch the YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgY7ql1xwW4) video in which Greg talks to the author of SolidJS, Ryan Carniato, about Leptos.
5) Watch some great Leptos videos on YouTube to familiarize yourself with the concepts of the framework, like [Fine Grained Reactivity with Leptos, Rust, and WASM by Chris Biscardi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BolA2WTH7U).
6) Read the [official documentation](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/).  In the top left corner you'll see a single cube in the header nav with an arrow. Within that menu you'll find a list of dependencies to crates used by leptos, which explain more features in detail, like `leptos_server`, `leptos_reactive`, `leptos_dom`, and `leptos_config`
7) Take a look at the [official Leptos repo](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos) for the most up to date inline documentation.
8) Review and build projects from [the examples folder](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/tree/main/examples) which show how Leptos can be used to build applications.

The community working on Leptos is aware of the missing pieces and are working hard to grow the framework while helping other people get involved. If you see a specific topic not covered in documentation, we invite you to author the article and lend a hand to those who come after you.
